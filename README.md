# 1. Introduction

Sahayak is a full-stack disaster response and volunteer coordination platform designed to improve emergency management during natural disasters, accidents, medical emergencies, fires, floods, and infrastructure failures.

The platform enables citizens to report emergencies, allows administrators to validate and prioritize incidents, automatically assigns suitable volunteers, tracks mission execution, collects proof of task completion, and verifies completed missions through an administrative review process.

The system is designed to reduce response time, improve volunteer utilization, and provide transparency throughout the disaster management lifecycle.

---

# 2. Problem Statement

During emergencies, information is often fragmented across multiple channels. Citizens struggle to reach responders, administrators lack centralized visibility, and volunteers are assigned manually without considering skills, availability, or location.

Existing systems typically suffer from:

* Delayed incident reporting
* Poor volunteer coordination
* Lack of proof-based verification
* Limited situational awareness
* No centralized monitoring dashboard
* Manual task allocation

Sahayak addresses these challenges through an integrated emergency response platform.

* Enable rapid emergency reporting
* Provide AI-assisted incident assessment
* Improve volunteer assignment efficiency
* Maintain proof-based accountability
* Offer centralized monitoring for administrators
* Reduce emergency response delays
* Improve disaster management transparency
